Common throughout New Zealand, the most extensive examples of this ecosystem in Auckland occur on Aotea. With concentrations at Kaitoke Swamp and wetlands in the Claris and Whangapoua area. This ecosystem type has been severely reduced in extent due to fire and drainage over the last 800 years. Around 390ha are mapped in the CEL, but the large wetlands on Aotea contribute 66% of the regional total. This makes this manuka fen more vulnerable to localised severe storms or climatic events that effect Aotea. As a wetland ecosystem manuka fens are inherently vulnerable to any increase in the frequency and/ or severity of droughts and floods which increase sediment and nutrient input. Weeds and fires are probably the biggest current threats to manuka fens (Singers et al. 2017), and climate effects that exacerbate these threats are a key risk for this ecosystem type."
