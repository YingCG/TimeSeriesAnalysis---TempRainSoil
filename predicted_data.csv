2024-06-21 12:00:00,10.5,30.2,15.4,-40,Normal,Agathis australis,Stout, coniferous forest tree,Nationally vulnerable,Moderate risk,Manuka-tangle fern fen,{WL12},(CRITICALLY ENDANGERED),[Overall moderatelow risk],Manuka fens are medium fertility wetlands that occur in places that are seasonally wet and dry. Common throughout New Zealand, the most extensive examples of this ecosystem in Auckland occur on Aotea. With concentrations at Kaitoke Swamp and wetlands in the Claris and Whangapoua area. This ecosystem type has been severely reduced in extent due to fire and drainage over the last 800 years. Around 390ha are mapped in the CEL, but the large wetlands on Aotea contribute 66% of the regional total. This makes this manuka fen more vulnerable to localised severe storms or climatic events that effect Aotea. As a wetland ecosystem manuka fens are inherently vulnerable to any increase in the frequency and/ or severity of droughts and floods which increase sediment and nutrient input. Weeds and fires are probably the biggest current threats to manuka fens (Singers et al. 2017), and climate effects that exacerbate these threats are a key risk for this ecosystem type.
2024-06-22 12:00:00,15.2,28.8,16.7,-55,Severely drier than normal (imminent drought),Amphibromus fluitans,Weakly tufted, semi-aquatic grass,Nationally endangered,Moderate risk,Lakeshore turf,{WL15},(CRITICALLY ENDANGERED),[Overall moderate-high risk],This ephemeral wetland ecosystem occupies a narrow band of habitat on shallow-gradient, fluctuating lake shorelines (Johnson 1972). Knowledge of its distribution in Auckland is incomplete, although we know it is very sparsely distributed as the environmental conditions in which it grows are very rare. Across the whole Auckland Region just 5ha of lakeshore turf is mapped in the CEL. Although this is almost certainly an under-estimate of its true extent it is a very rare ecosystem type. Its limited distribution may make it more vulnerable to climatic disturbances, however the ephemeral nature of lakeshore turf wetlands means they are well adapted to moving around the landscape in ‘search’ of habitat. If suitable habitat remains, then it is likely that this ecosystem will also remain.
2024-06-23 12:00:00,5.7,32.1,15.9,-70,Extremely dry,Anogramma leptophylla,Small winter dormant fern,Nationally vulnerable,Moderate-high risk,Flaxland,{WL18},(CRITICALLY ENDANGERED),[Overall moderate risk],Flaxlands are swamps which occur on young landforms that regularly flood or receive surface flow from surrounding land (Bagnall and Ogle 1981). They are widespread throughout NZ, although their extent has been severely reduced by draining in most regions, including Auckland. Their regional distribution is very patchy; a total of only 54ha of flaxland is mapped in the current ecosystem layer, with an average size of just 0.7 ha. Many flaxland remnants are associated with coastal lakes and duneland wetlands, which means they are in an area that is particularly exposed to disturbance from increased frequency and/ or severity of storms, and sea-level rise. However, the relative vulnerability of individual remnants likely to be highly site specific.
